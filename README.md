# Plugin Architecture Intro Lab

This is a lab of UMJI VE280 Programming & Elem. Data Structures (2021Summer section). 

Though the main topic is class inheritance, It is aimed to expose students a bit to plugin architecture, C++11 feature, some Linux C++ programming that will never be covered in class but will be used in EECS/VE 482: Intro to Operating Systems.

The description file presented to students is `description.md`. Also serves as the secondary README file.

The nyan cat execute file is compiled with codes from `klange/nyancat` ([https://github.com/klange/nyancat](https://github.com/klange/nyancat)).

More details are presented on `description.md`
